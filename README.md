# SBU_DAS_Fall25_Final_Review

only 100% self-made resources will be publich on this repo.

I attach the reply from ChatGPT.

# Direct copies of slides / homework / tests

These are 100% copyrighted by the professor or the university.

Uploading them publicly = copyright violation

→ Even if it’s just a little

→ Even if you “combine” it with your own notes

→ Even if you put MIT license on the repo

→ Even if you credit the professor

MIT license does not give you permission to redistribute someone else’s copyrighted material.


# If the materials are 100% yours (your LaTeX notes, your code, your own explanations)
Then yes — you can put them on GitHub publicly and license them MIT.

You are the creator → you control the copyright → you choose the license.

BUT:

If your LaTeX notes quote or reproduce professor text (e.g., copy–paste homework questions or slide text), that part is not yours.

Safe approach:

Rewrite everything in your own words.

Do NOT include the original problem statements unless professor or university explicitly allows it.

# A clean way to do it

You can safely publish if you do:

Your own notes (paraphrased, original text)

Your own diagrams

Your own LaTeX explanations

Your own code or solutions

No direct copy of slides, homework, or test problems.

If you want to discuss problems, rewrite them fully in your own way.
